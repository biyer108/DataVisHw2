## Data Cleaning
1) I first worked with removing Blank Rows within the file.
2) Then removed the Gross Column.
3) Finally, I trimmed the Movie titles so that leading and subsequent spaces would be removed.

## Analyzed Clean Data

1) There are 81 rows that are movies that were superhits in 2021.  I first added a text filter for 2021 for both the startYear and EndYear.  I then applied another text filter for Verdict to check for Super Hit

2) - Animation: She-Ra and the Princesses of Power
   - Action: She-Ra and the Princesses of Power
